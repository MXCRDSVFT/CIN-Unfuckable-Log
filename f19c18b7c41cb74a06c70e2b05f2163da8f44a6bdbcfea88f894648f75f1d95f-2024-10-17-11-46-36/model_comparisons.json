Since 2016, NATO\u2019s support has been organised through a Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP), which includes a wide range of capacity-building programmes and trust funds, focused on key areas like cyber defence, logistics and countering hybrid warfare. Allied Leaders agreed a strengthened CAP at the 2022 Madrid Summit, and further support to Ukraine under the CAP at the 2023 Vilnius Summit and 2024 Washington Summit.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, NATO and Allies have been providing unprecedented levels of support to Ukraine (see FAQ #5 above).\n\nLearn more: \u301067\u2020Relations with Ukraine\u3011\n\n  * ## 7. What is NATO\u2019s position on Ukraine\u2019s occupied territories?\n\nSince Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea and destabilisation of eastern Ukraine in 2014, NATO has adopted a firm position in full support of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. The Allies strongly condemn and do not recognise Russia\u2019s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, and denounce its temporary occupation.\n\nNATO also condemns Russia\u2019s illegal attempt to annex four regions of Ukraine \u2013 Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia \u2013 in September 2022, which is the largest attempted annexation of European territory by force since the Second World War. The sham referenda in these regions were engineered in Moscow and imposed on Ukraine. They have no legitimacy, and NATO does not recognise them. These lands are Ukraine and will always be Ukraine. The overwhelming vote in the United Nations General Assembly condemning Russia\u2019s attempted annexations sent a clear and strong message that Russia is isolated and that the world stands with Ukraine, in defence of the rules-based international order.\n\nLearn more: \u301073\u2020Statement by the North Atlantic Council on the so-called \u201creferenda\u201d in parts of Ukraine\u3011  \nLearn more: \u301074\u2020NATO Secretary General condemns Russia\u2019s illegal attempts to annex Ukrainian territory\u3011\n\n  * ## 8. Why isn\u2019t NATO sending troops or closing the skies over Ukraine?\n\nNATO\u2019s actions are defensive, designed not to provoke conflict but to prevent conflict. The Alliance has a responsibility to ensure that this war does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine, which would be even more devastating and dangerous. Enforcing a no-fly zone or deploying combat troops to Ukraine would bring NATO forces into direct conflict with Russia. This would significantly escalate the war and lead to more human suffering and destruction for all countries involved.\n\nLearn more: \u301075\u2020NATO Secretary General press conference, 23 March 2022\u3011\n\n  * ## 9. What are NATO and Allies doing to impose costs on Russia?\n\nNATO Allies and partners have imposed unprecedented costs on Russia, including severe sanctions that are helping starve the Kremlin\u2019s war machine of resources. Allies continue to refine the sanctions in order to increase the pressure on Moscow. These efforts will make it harder for Russia to rebuild its tanks, manufacture missiles and finance its war.\n\nPresident Putin\u2019s decision to attack Ukraine is a terrible strategic mistake, for which Russia will pay a heavy price, both economically and politically, for years to come.\n\nLearn more: \u301072\u2020Statement by NATO Heads of State and Government, 24 March 2022\u3011\n\n  * ## 10. What is NATO doing to enhance the defence of its countries and citizens?\n\nFollowing\u00a0Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Allies activated NATO\u2019s defence plans and deployed thousands of extra troops from both sides of the Atlantic. NATO rapidly established four new multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, in addition to the existing battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The eight battlegroups extend all along NATO\u2019s eastern flank, from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south. Today, NATO has 500,000 troops at high readiness working across all domains \u2013 land, sea, air, cyber and space.\n\nAt the 2022 Madrid Summit, Allies agreed a fundamental shift in NATO\u2019s deterrence and defence. This included strengthening forward defences, preparing the battlegroups in the eastern part of the Alliance to be enhanced from battalions up to brigade level, transforming the NATO Response Force and increasing the number of high-readiness forces to well over 300,000. These forces will be underpinned by more pre-positioned equipment and supplies; more forward-deployed capabilities; and upgraded defence plans, with forces pre-assigned to defend specific Allies. All of this constitutes the biggest overhaul of Allied collective defence and deterrence since the Cold War.\n\nAt the 2023 Vilnius Summit, Allies built upon their Madrid decisions by approving new regional defence plans to counter the two main threats to the Alliance: Russia and terrorism. NATO Leaders also pledged to invest a minimum of 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually on defence, and endorsed a Defence Production Action Plan to accelerate joint procurement, boost interoperability and generate investment and production capacity. Under this Action Plan, Allies have agreed more than USD 10 billion in framework contracts, covering critical needs like 155 mm artillery, anti-tank guided missiles and main battle tank ammunition.\n\nAt the 2024 Washington Summit, Allies reaffirmed their commitment to investing 2% of GDP in defence (noting that two thirds of Allies have reached that threshold) and pledged to expand their defence industrial capacity to urgently deliver the most critical capabilities. They welcomed the progress made since the Madrid and Vilnius Summits on reinforcing and modernising NATO for a new era of collective defence, and agreed to further enhance NATO\u2019s Integrated Air and Missile Defence with new ballistic missile defence assets, and to boost NATO\u2019s cyber defence with a new NATO Integrated Cyber Defence Centre.\n\nNATO Allies are also increasing the resilience of their societies and infrastructure. This includes enhancing cyber capabilities and defences, and providing support to each other in the event of cyber attacks. Following the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Allies have enhanced their naval presence in the Baltic and North Seas, and are increasing security around other key installations and pieces of critical infrastructure. NATO members are stepping up intelligence-sharing and surveillance across all domains, to ensure the protection of critical undersea and energy infrastructure. Allies are also enhancing their preparedness for chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats, strengthening their energy security, and boosting resilience to hybrid threats, including disinformation.\n\nLearn more: \u301019\u2020Deterrence and defence\u3011\u00a0  \nLearn more: \u301076\u2020NATO\u2019s military presence in the east of the Alliance\u3011  \nLearn more: \u301077\u2020Resilience and Article 3\u3011  \nLearn more: \u301078\u2020NATO\u2019s role in defence industry production\u3011\n\n  * ## 11. What is NATO\u2019s response to Russia\u2019s dangerous rhetoric around nuclear, chemical and biological weapons?\n\nRussia\u2019s threatening nuclear rhetoric is dangerous and irresponsible. NATO takes these threats seriously, but will not be intimidated. NATO remains vigilant and conveys a clear message to Russia that a nuclear war cannot be won and should never be fought. Any use of nuclear weapons by Russia would fundamentally change the nature of the war, and it would have severe consequences for Russia. Furthermore, NATO Allies are profoundly concerned by the reported use of chemical weapons by Russia against Ukrainian forces. Any use by Russia of a chemical or biological weapon would be a violation of international law and a war crime, and result in severe consequences.\u00a0\n\nLearn more: \u301079\u2020Weapons of mass destruction\u3011  \nLearn more: \u301080\u2020Combined Joint Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defence Task Force\u3011\n\n  * ## 12. What is NATO\u2019s position on countries supporting Russia\u2019s war?\n\nNATO condemns all those who are facilitating, and thereby prolonging, Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine.\n\nBelarus continues to enable Russia\u2019s war by making available its territory and infrastructure, including for Russia\u2019s announced stationing of nuclear weapons in Belarus.\n\nNorth Korea and Iran are fuelling Russia\u2019s war of aggression against Ukraine by providing direct military support to Russia, such as munitions and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs).\n\nThe People\u2019s

 * English\n  * \u301062\u2020French\u3011 \n  * \u301063\u2020Russian\u3011 \n  * \u301064\u2020Ukrainian\u3011 \n\nThe NATO Invitee associates itself with this Statement. \n\n[Image 11] \n\nToday we solemnly mark two years of Russia\u2019s brutal full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and ten years since Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea and initial military intervention in the Donbas.\u00a0 The men and women of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the people of Ukraine continue to inspire the world with their resolve and bravery in the heroic defence of their nation, their land, and our shared values.\u00a0 We pay tribute to the lives lost and we deplore the tragic human suffering and destruction caused by Russia\u2019s illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war.\u00a0 Russia has failed in its efforts to undermine Ukraine\u2019s statehood and break the resolve of the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 Ukraine has prevailed as a sovereign and democratic nation, liberating significant territory and pushing back Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet.\n\nRussia bears full responsibility for this war, a blatant violation of international law including the UN Charter, for which it must be held fully accountable.\u00a0 There can be no impunity for Russian war crimes and violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law, including the forced deportation of children and conflict-related sexual violence.\u00a0 We condemn Russia\u2019s appalling attacks against Ukraine\u2019s cities and its civilian, energy, and port infrastructure, some of which have also impacted Allied territory.\u00a0 We also condemn all those who are facilitating Russia\u2019s war and amplifying Russia\u2019s disinformation.\u00a0 Russia must immediately stop this war and completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from Ukraine in line with UN General Assembly resolutions.\u00a0 We do not and will never recognise Russia\u2019s illegal and illegitimate annexations, including Crimea.\u00a0 Russia has not shown any genuine openness to a just and lasting peace.\u00a0 Allies welcome and support President Zelenskyy\u2019s commitment in setting out the principles for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace through his Peace Formula.\u00a0\n\nAllies remain as resolute as ever in supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes for Ukraine to prevail.\u00a0 We welcome efforts of all Allies and partners agreeing bilateral long-term security commitments and arrangements with Ukraine.\u00a0 As Ukraine exercises its inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter, Allies and partners are providing ongoing military, financial, and humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 NATO continues to support Ukraine with urgently needed non-lethal equipment and supplies to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s self-defence. \u00a0NATO is committed to help strengthen and rebuild the Ukrainian security and defence sector, support Ukraine\u2019s deterrence and defence in the long term, and transition Ukraine to full interoperability with NATO.\u00a0 Work is ongoing on long-term recovery and reform including on air and missile defence, humanitarian demining, medical rehabilitation for wounded Ukrainian soldiers, support to veterans, post-war reconstruction, defence procurement, and strengthening Ukraine\u2019s defence industrial capacity.\u00a0 We have also agreed to establish a NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis, Training, and Education Centre in Poland to identify and apply lessons learned from Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.\n\nA strong, independent, and democratic Ukraine is vital for the stability of the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00a0 Ukraine\u2019s fight for its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders directly contributes to Euro-Atlantic security.\u00a0 In the NATO-Ukraine Council, Allies and Ukraine are working closely and taking decisions together, as equals, to support Ukraine\u2019s further integration with NATO, in line with Vilnius Summit decisions.\u00a0 Ukraine\u2019s future is in NATO.\u00a0 Allies and Ukraine stand together.\n\n#  Topics

How has NATO supported Ukraine since Russia illegally annexed Crimea in 2014?\n\nSince Russia\u2019s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea in 2014, NATO has helped to reform Ukraine\u2019s armed forces and defence institutions, including with equipment and financial support. Allies have also provided training for tens of thousands of Ukrainian troops. Ukrainian forces have also developed their capabilities by participating in NATO exercises and operations. Since 2016, NATO\u2019s support has been organised through a Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP), which includes a wide range of capacity-building programmes and trust funds, focused on key areas like cyber defence, logistics and countering hybrid warfare. Allied Leaders agreed a strengthened CAP at the 2022 Madrid Summit, and further support to Ukraine under the CAP at the 2023 Vilnius Summit and 2024 Washington Summit.\n\nSince Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion in February 2022, NATO and Allies have been providing unprecedented levels of support to Ukraine (see FAQ #5 above).\n\nLearn more: \u301067\u2020Relations with Ukraine\u3011\n\n  * ## 7. What is NATO\u2019s position on Ukraine\u2019s occupied territories?\n\nSince Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea and destabilisation of eastern Ukraine in 2014, NATO has adopted a firm position in full support of Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. The Allies strongly condemn and do not recognise Russia\u2019s illegal and illegitimate annexation of Crimea, and denounce its temporary occupation.\n\nNATO also condemns Russia\u2019s illegal attempt to annex four regions of Ukraine \u2013 Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia \u2013 in September 2022, which is the largest attempted annexation of European territory by force since the Second World War. The sham referenda in these regions were engineered in Moscow and imposed on Ukraine. They have no legitimacy, and NATO does not recognise them. These lands are Ukraine and will always be Ukraine. The overwhelming vote in the United Nations General Assembly condemning Russia\u2019s attempted annexations sent a clear and strong message that Russia is isolated and that the world stands with Ukraine, in defence of the rules-based international order.\n\nLearn more: \u301073\u2020Statement by the North Atlantic Council on the so-called \u201creferenda\u201d in parts of Ukraine\u3011  \nLearn more: \u301074\u2020NATO Secretary General condemns Russia\u2019s illegal attempts to annex Ukrainian territory\u3011\n\n  * ## 8. Why isn\u2019t NATO sending troops or closing the skies over Ukraine?\n\nNATO\u2019s actions are defensive, designed not to provoke conflict but to prevent conflict. The Alliance has a responsibility to ensure that this war does not escalate and spread beyond Ukraine, which would be even more devastating and dangerous. Enforcing a no-fly zone or deploying combat troops to Ukraine would bring NATO forces into direct conflict with Russia. This would significantly escalate the war and lead to more human suffering and destruction for all countries involved.\n\nLearn more: \u301075\u2020NATO Secretary General press conference, 23 March 2022\u3011\n\n  * ## 9. What are NATO and Allies doing to impose costs on Russia?\n\nNATO Allies and partners have imposed unprecedented costs on Russia, including severe sanctions that are helping starve the Kremlin\u2019s war machine of resources. Allies continue to refine the sanctions in order to increase the pressure on Moscow. These efforts will make it harder for Russia to rebuild its tanks, manufacture missiles and finance its war.\n\nPresident Putin\u2019s decision to attack Ukraine is a terrible strategic mistake, for which Russia will pay a heavy price, both economically and politically, for years to come.\n\nLearn more: \u301072\u2020Statement by NATO Heads of State and Government, 24 March 2022\u3011\n\n  * ## 10. What is NATO doing to enhance the defence of its countries and citizens?\n\nFollowing\u00a0Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Allies activated NATO\u2019s defence plans and deployed thousands of extra troops from both sides of the Atlantic. NATO rapidly established four new multinational battlegroups in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia, in addition to the existing battlegroups in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The eight battlegroups extend all along NATO\u2019s eastern flank, from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the south. Today, NATO has 500,000 troops at high readiness working across all domains \u2013 land, sea, air, cyber and space.\n\nAt the 2022 Madrid Summit, Allies agreed a fundamental shift in NATO\u2019s deterrence and defence. This included strengthening forward defences, preparing the battlegroups in the eastern part of the Alliance to be enhanced from battalions up to brigade level, transforming the NATO Response Force and increasing the number of high-readiness forces to well over 300,000. These forces will be underpinned by more pre-positioned equipment and supplies; more forward-deployed capabilities; and upgraded defence plans, with forces pre-assigned to defend specific Allies. All of this constitutes the biggest overhaul of Allied collective defence and deterrence since the Cold War.\n\nAt the 2023 Vilnius Summit, Allies built upon their Madrid decisions by approving new regional defence plans to counter the two main threats to the Alliance: Russia and terrorism. NATO Leaders also pledged to invest a minimum of 2% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) annually on defence, and endorsed a Defence Production Action Plan to accelerate joint procurement, boost interoperability and generate investment and production capacity. Under this Action Plan, Allies have agreed more than USD 10 billion in framework contracts, covering critical needs like 155 mm artillery, anti-tank guided missiles and main battle tank ammunition.\n\nAt the 2024 Washington Summit, Allies reaffirmed their commitment to investing 2% of GDP in defence (noting that two thirds of Allies have reached that threshold) and pledged to expand their defence industrial capacity to urgently deliver the most critical capabilities. They welcomed the progress made since the Madrid and Vilnius Summits on reinforcing and modernising NATO for a new era of collective defence, and agreed to further enhance NATO\u2019s Integrated Air and Missile Defence with new ballistic missile defence assets, and to boost NATO\u2019s cyber defence with a new NATO Integrated Cyber Defence Centre.\n\nNATO Allies are also increasing the resilience of their societies and infrastructure. This includes enhancing cyber capabilities and defences, and providing support to each other in the event of cyber attacks. Following the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipelines, Allies have enhanced their naval presence in the Baltic and North Seas, and are increasing security around other key installations and pieces of critical infrastructure.

solemnly mark two years of Russia\u2019s brutal full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and ten years since Russia\u2019s illegal annexation of Crimea and initial military intervention in the Donbas.\u00a0 The men and women of the Ukrainian Armed Forces and the people of Ukraine continue to inspire the world with their resolve and bravery in the heroic defence of their nation, their land, and our shared values.\u00a0 We pay tribute to the lives lost and we deplore the tragic human suffering and destruction caused by Russia\u2019s illegal, unjustifiable, and unprovoked war.\u00a0 Russia has failed in its efforts to undermine Ukraine\u2019s statehood and break the resolve of the Ukrainian people.\u00a0 Ukraine has prevailed as a sovereign and democratic nation, liberating significant territory and pushing back Russia\u2019s Black Sea fleet.\n\nRussia bears full responsibility for this war, a blatant violation of international law including the UN Charter, for which it must be held fully accountable.\u00a0 There can be no impunity for Russian war crimes and violations and abuses of human rights and international humanitarian law, including the forced deportation of children and conflict-related sexual violence.\u00a0 We condemn Russia\u2019s appalling attacks against Ukraine\u2019s cities and its civilian, energy, and port infrastructure, some of which have also impacted Allied territory.\u00a0 We also condemn all those who are facilitating Russia\u2019s war and amplifying Russia\u2019s disinformation.\u00a0 Russia must immediately stop this war and completely and unconditionally withdraw all of its military forces from Ukraine in line with UN General Assembly resolutions.\u00a0 We do not and will never recognise Russia\u2019s illegal and illegitimate annexations, including Crimea.\u00a0 Russia has not shown any genuine openness to a just and lasting peace.\u00a0 Allies welcome and support President Zelenskyy\u2019s commitment in setting out the principles for a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace through his Peace Formula.\u00a0\n\nAllies remain as resolute as ever in supporting Ukraine for as long as it takes for Ukraine to prevail.\u00a0 We welcome efforts of all Allies and partners agreeing bilateral long-term security commitments and arrangements with Ukraine.\u00a0 As Ukraine exercises its inherent right to self-defence as enshrined in Article 51 of the UN Charter, Allies and partners are providing ongoing military, financial, and humanitarian assistance.\u00a0 NATO continues to support Ukraine with urgently needed non-lethal equipment and supplies to strengthen Ukraine\u2019s self-defence. \u00a0NATO is committed to help strengthen and rebuild the Ukrainian security and defence sector, support Ukraine\u2019s deterrence and defence in the long term, and transition Ukraine to full interoperability with NATO.\u00a0 Work is ongoing on long-term recovery and reform including on air and missile defence, humanitarian demining, medical rehabilitation for wounded Ukrainian soldiers, support to veterans, post-war reconstruction, defence procurement, and strengthening Ukraine\u2019s defence industrial capacity.\u00a0 We have also agreed to establish a NATO-Ukraine Joint Analysis, Training, and Education Centre in Poland to identify and apply lessons learned from Russia\u2019s war against Ukraine.\n\nA strong, independent, and democratic Ukraine is vital for the stability of the Euro-Atlantic area.\u00a0 Ukraine\u2019s fight for its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders directly contributes to Euro-Atlantic security.\u00a0 In the NATO-Ukraine Council, Allies and Ukraine are working closely and taking decisions together, as equals, to support Ukraine\u2019s further integration with NATO, in line with Vilnius Summit decisions.\u00a0 Ukraine\u2019s future is in NATO.\u00a0 Allies and Ukraine stand together.\n\n#  Topics

 * \n\n  * English\n  * \u301062\u2020French\u3011 \n  * \u301063\u2020Russian\u3011 \n  * \u301064\u2020Ukrainian\u3011 \n\nThe NATO-Ukraine Council met on Wednesday (10 January 2024) following recent waves of heavy Russian airstrikes against Ukrainian civilians and infrastructure. Allies strongly condemned the escalation in Russian air strikes on Ukraine, as well as Russia's use of ballistic missiles sourced from North Korea and drones from Iran. \n\n[Image 11: Meeting of the NATO-Ukraine Council] \n\nAllies have already delivered a vast array of air defence systems to Ukraine and today they reaffirmed their commitment to further bolster Ukraine\u2019s defences. Through NATO, Allies are buying up to 1,000 Patriot air defence missiles to replenish their stockpiles as they continue to bolster Ukraine\u2019s air defences. Germany recently delivered Patriot and Skynex air defence systems and additional missiles for IRIS-T air defences to Ukraine, and the United Kingdom is sending around 200 air defence missiles to Ukraine. Today, Allies made clear that they will continue to provide Ukraine with major military, economic, and humanitarian assistance, and many Allies outlined plans to provide billions of euros of further capabilities in 2024. \u00a0\n\nSecretary General Jens Stoltenberg said: \u201cNATO strongly condemns Russian missile and drone attacks on Ukrainian civilians, including with weapons from North Korea and Iran. For a second year in a row, Putin is trying to wear down Ukraine with mass strikes, but he will not succeed. Russia\u2019s campaign of cruelty only strengthens Ukraine\u2019s resolve. As Moscow intensifies its strikes on Ukrainian cities and civilians, NATO Allies are boosting Ukraine\u2019s air defences. We will continue to stand by the brave Ukrainians as they push back against Russia\u2019s war of aggression.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s meeting was held at ambassadorial level and was convened at Ukraine\u2019s request. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg chaired the Council. NATO ambassadors and invitee Sweden were briefed by videoconference by Lieutenant General Mykola Oleshchuk, the Commander of the Ukrainian Air Force, and Deputy Interior Minister Oleksii Serhieiev. The NATO-Ukraine Council was created at the NATO Summit in July 2023 and serves as a forum for joint consultations, decision-making and activities between NATO and Ukraine.\n\n#  Video\n\n  * [Image 12: NATO continues to support Ukraine as Russia shows no signs of seeking peace] \n\n    * NATO continues to support Ukraine as Russia shows no signs of seeking peace 10 Jan. 2024\n\n#  Topics \n\n  * \u301065\u2020 Relations with Ukraine \u3011 \n\n  * \u301066\u2020 NATO-Ukraine Council \u3011 \n\n\u301067\u2020 \u3011\n\n\u301068\u2020Back To Top\u3011\n\nSubscribe to NATO Updates \n\nYou must provide an address\n\nThis is not a valid e-mail address!\n\nSomething went wrong sending the address\n\n## About us\n\n  * \u30102\u2020NATO\u2019s 75th Anniversary\u3011 \n  * \u30103\u2020What is NATO?\u3011 \n  * \u30104\u2020Founding Treaty\u3011 \n  * \u30105\u2020NATO member countries\u3011 \n  * \u30106\u2020NATO\u2019s partnerships\u3011 \n  * \u30107\u2020Structure \u3011 \n  * \u30108\u2020Who's who?\u3011 \n  * \u30109\u2020Secretary General\u3011 \n  * \u301010\u2020NATO History\u3011 \n  * \u301011\u2020NATO on the Map\u3011 \n  * \u301012\u2020Strategic Concepts\u3011 \n  * \u301013\u2020Dispatches from the field \u3011 \n  * \u301014\u2020We are NATO \u3011 \n  * \u301015\u2020Funding NATO\u3011 \n\n## What we do\n\n  * \u301017\u2020Encyclopedia of NATO Topics \u3011 \n  * \u301018\u2020Collective defence and Article 5 \u3011 \n  * \u301019\u2020Deterrence and defence\u3011 \n  * \u301020\u2020De-bunking Russian disinformation on NATO\u3011 \n  * \u301021\u2020NATO-Ukraine relations\u3011 \n  * \u301022\u2020Operations and missions\u3011 \n  * \u301023\u2020Exercises \u3011 \n  * \u301024\u2020Cyber defence\u3011 \n  * \u301025\u2020Environment, climate change and security\u3011 \n  * \u301026\u2020Women, Peace and Security\u3011 \n\n## Newsroom\n\n  * \u301028\u2020News\u3011 \n  * \u301029\u2020Media advisories\u3011 \n  * \u301030\u2020Press Office contacts\u3011 \n  * \u301031\u2020Media accreditation\u3011 \n  * \u301032\u2020Speeches & transcripts\u3011 \n  * \u301033\u2020Factsheets \u3011 \n  * \u301034\u2020Photos\u3011 \n  * \u301035\u2020Video \u3011 \n  * \u301036\u2020Audio\u3011 \n  * \u301037\u2020Event programmes\u3011 \n  * \u301038\u2020Official texts\u3011 \n  * \u301039\u2020Use of content \u3011 \n\n## Work with us\n\n  * \u301041\u2020Careers at ", "title": "NATO - News: NATO-Ukraine Council meets, Allies pledge further air defences, 10-Jan.-2024", "tether_id": null}, "status": "finished_successfully", "end_turn": null, "weight": 0.0, "recipient": "all", "channel": null}, {"id": "8a803eee-c4a8-4d0d-bc40-4bb90d9b2337", "author": {"role": "assistant", "name": null}, "create_time": 1727807917.519555, "update_time": null, "content": {"content_type": "text", "parts": ["NATO's involvement in the Ukraine conflict has focused on extensive support for Ukraine's defense capabilities without direct military engagement to avoid escalating the conflict further.
